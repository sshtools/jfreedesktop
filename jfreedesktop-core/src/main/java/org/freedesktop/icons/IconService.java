/**
 * Implementations of this service interface provide an easy way for Java to use
 * the Freedesktop <a href=
 * "http://standards.freedesktop.org/icon-theme-spec/icon-theme-spec-latest.html">Icon
 * Theme Specification</a>
 * <p>
 * To use the API, you must add (in the order that the locations should be
 * searched) at lease one <i>Base</i> directory using the
 * {@link #addBase(Path)} method.
 * <p>
 * You should also select a theme using
 * {@link ThemeService#setSelectedTheme(org.freedesktop.themes.Theme)}. If no theme is selected,
 * the first theme found is used.
 * <p>
 * To find an icon file, use {@link #findIcon(String, int)}. Only supply the
 * filename without the prefix (for example, <i>user-home</i>, not
 * <i>user-home.png</i>). Specify a size in pixels to locate the icon that
 * closest matches (use {@link Integer#MAX_VALUE} to get the biggest available
 * and {@link Integer#MIN_VALUE} to get the smallest).
 * <p>
 * Themes are keyed by their <i>internal name</i>. This is the file name of the
 * directory the theme definition file is located in.
 * <p>
 * If an icon is not found in the selected theme, the themes parent will then be
 * searched, and then its parent etc until a theme with no parent is reached.
 * <p>
 * If the icon is not found, the <i>hicolor</i> theme will then be searched in
 * the same manner. Finally, if the icon is still not found, then the root of
 * each base directory will be searched for any image files that are prefixed
 * with the required name.
 * <p>
 * When no icon file is found using any of the above methods,
 * {@link #findIcon(String, int)} will either return <code>null</code> or the
 * location of the <i>image-missing</i> special image (if that can be found).
 * <p>
 * See the specification in the link above for a complete description of the
 * search algorithm.
